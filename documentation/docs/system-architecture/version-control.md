# Version Control

Educude will be created on **GitHub**. 

- **Docusaurus** is where we will be documenting our progess and intent.
- The **Frontend** will be built with **TypeScript** and **Python**
- The **Backend** will be utilizing **MongoDB**.

## Repository Structure

**Main Branch** will contain the most recent form of EduCode.

**Supplementary Branches** contain different features that will be
continuously merged to main upon completion.

## Branch Protection

**Code security** and **neatness** is very important when managing a large project.
Which is why we implemented **strict rules** when attempting to merge branches.

- Before merging a supplementary branch with main, the developer must receive an approval from one of their peers.
