# Introduction
Copilot Clone is an AI pair programmer focused on making sure students are working alongside AI, not having it just complete work for them.
Copilot Clone suggests helpful code, and then tracks metrics like accuracy of student code or the time they take to accept suggestions. These metrics can provide educators
with valuable insight on a student's ability to work with AI.
