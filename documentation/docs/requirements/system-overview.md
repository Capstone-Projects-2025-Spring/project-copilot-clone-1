# System Overview

## Project Abstract
Many students use AI assistant tools such as ChatGPT to assist them with their programming sessions. However, it's been proven that students have been using these tools improperly which hinders the development process. Github Copilot Clone proposes a solution to this problem by coming packaged with familiar features such as real-time code suggestion and generation. As well as monitoring features that generate helpful metrics to improve usage.

## Conceptual Design
Github Copilot Clone will be a VSCode extension. The frontend of the application will be written in TypeScript or JavaScript. The backend will use ___ 

## Background
