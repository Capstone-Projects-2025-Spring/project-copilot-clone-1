# System Overview

## Project Abstract
Many students use AI assistant tools such as ChatGPT to assist them with their programming sessions. However, it's been proven that students have been using these tools improperly which hinders the development process. Github Copilot Clone proposes a solution to this problem by coming packaged with familiar features such as real-time code suggestion and generation. As well as monitoring features that generate helpful metrics to improve usage.

## Conceptual Design
Copilot Clone will be a VSCode extension. The frontend of the application will be written in TypeScript, HTML, and CSS using the VS Code API which provides functionality for the interface of the application. The backend will consist of a server to make calls to OpenAI, handle API requests from the client side, and communicate with the database.

## Background
Similar products are [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/) and [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). These are both closed-source AI assistants, where ChatGPT is prompt based and multipurposed. Whereas, Github Copilot contains a prompted chat mode as well as real-time code suggestions. Github Copilot Clone separates itself from these products with its logging capabilities geared towards promoting the effective use of AI Assistants.
